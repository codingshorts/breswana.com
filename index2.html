												<h2>What's a dog breed</h2>
												<article><p>People have been breeding dogs since <mark>prehistoric</mark> times. The earliest dog breeders used wolves to create domestic dogs. From the beginning, humans purposefully bred dogs to perform various tasks. Hunting, guarding, and herding are thought to be among the earliest jobs eagerly performed by the animal destined to be called “man’s best friend.”</p>
												<p>
																For thousands of years, humans bred dogs toward the physical and mental traits best suited for the work expected of them. The sleek Greyhound types bred to chase fleet-footed prey, and the huge mastiff types used as guard dogs and warriors, are two ancient examples of dogs bred for specific jobs.
												</p>
												<p>
																There are over 340 dog breeds known throughout the world. The American Kennel Club recognizes 197 breeds.
